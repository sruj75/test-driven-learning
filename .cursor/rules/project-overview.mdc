## Core Learning Flow

The platform follows a test-first approach to learning:

1. User takes a test to identify knowledge gaps
2. System recommends audio-based learning resources
3. User marks resources as helpful/not helpful
4. System provides alternative resources if needed
5. After learning, user takes another test
6. This cycle repeats until mastery is achieved
