# Frontend Architecture

The TestDrivenLearning frontend is built with Next.js 14 using the App Router architecture. It follows a structured component organization and user flow.

## Page Structure

The application is organized into the following key pages:

- **Landing Page**: Chat interface for goal-setting and journey creation
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth sign-in flow
- **Dashboard**: Central hub for learning journey
- **Courses/Lessons**: Content delivery with embedded videos
- **Profile/Settings**: User profile and preference management
- **Payment**: Subscription plans and checkout flow

## Component Organization

Components are organized by functionality:

- `layout/` - Page layouts and navigation components
- `ui/` - Reusable UI components
- `auth/` - Authentication components
- `courses/` - Course-related components
- `payment/` - Payment-related components
- `chat/` - AI chat interface components

## User Flow

1. User lands on homepage with chat interface
2. After setting goals, user authenticates with Google
3. User subscribes to access personalized content
4. Dashboard displays learning journey with assessment interface
5. User takes tests and receives video recommendations
6. Progress is tracked across learning sessions
