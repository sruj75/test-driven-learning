# Implementation Plan for Test-Driven Learning Platform

## User Experience-Driven Implementation Approach

Following Steve Jobs' philosophy, we're building from user experience toward technology. We'll start by designing and implementing the frontend user experience, then adapt our backend to support that experience.

## Technical Approach (Based on Frontend Needs)

1. **UI-Driven Database Design**
   - Database schema will be derived from UI components and user flows
   - Tables and relationships will be created to support the user experience
   - We'll use Supabase's hybrid capabilities (relational + JSONB) for flexibility
   - Schema will evolve through iterations based on frontend requirements

2. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Implement authentication using Supabase UI Library components ([UI Library](https://supabase.com/ui))
   - Focus on creating a frictionless signup/login experience
   - Design user profiles based on learning needs
   - Keep authentication UI consistent with overall design system

3. **Frontend-Backend Communication**
   - Use Supabase client libraries for real-time data access
   - Implement client-side caching for performance
   - Design API calls around user interactions
   - Create fallbacks for offline scenarios

4. **Testing Framework Architecture**
   - Design test formats based on UI prototypes and user testing
   - Implement question types based on content needs
   - Structure data to support the visual representation of results
   - Optimize for real-time feedback and interactivity

5. **Infrastructure Considerations**
   - Optimize for frontend performance and responsiveness
   - Use SSR/ISR where appropriate for SEO and initial load speed
   - Set up analytics to track user experience metrics
   - Implement progressive enhancement for varying device capabilities
