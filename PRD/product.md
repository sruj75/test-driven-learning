# Product Requirements Document: Test-Driven Learning

## 1. Product Overview
- **Product Name**: TestLearn (tentative)
- **Product Vision**: Revolutionize learning by flipping the traditional model - make tests the starting point rather than the endpoint of learning, creating a personalized, efficient, and goal-driven educational experience.
- **Target Audience**: 
  - University students across disciplines (Computer Science, Engineering, Business, Humanities, etc.)
  - High school students preparing for exams or building foundational knowledge
  - Graduate students (Master's, PhD) focusing on specialized topics
  - International students adapting to different educational systems
  - Students struggling with traditional learning approaches
- **Problem Statement**: Traditional education follows a "teach first, test later" model which is inefficient and not personalized. Students waste time learning content they already know or don't need, and often fail to identify their specific knowledge gaps until after completing entire courses.

## 2. User Stories & Requirements

### Core Features:
1. **Goal Setting Interface**
   - Users can set learning objectives or select from predefined topics
   - System breaks down goals into testable concepts

2. **Dynamic Test Generation**

   - Multiple formats: multiple choice, short answer, coding problems depending on subject
   - Difficulty adapts based on user performance

3. **Gap Analysis**
   - Identifies knowledge gaps from test results
   - Visualizes strengths and weaknesses

4. **Personalized Learning Recommendations**
   - Recommends specific YouTube videos based on identified gaps
   - Provides concise LLM-generated summaries of concepts when needed

5. **Continuous Testing Loop**
   - Retesting with dynamically generated new questions
   - Focus on weak areas while maintaining coverage of all required concepts
   - Prevent memorization through question variation

  - AI/LLM: Groq Cloud API for fast inference
  - External APIs: YouTube Data API
  - Database: Supabase/PostgreSQL for user data and progress

- **Integration Requirements**:
  - YouTube API for video recommendations
  - LLM API for test generation and concept explanations
  - Authentication system
  - Analytics for user progress tracking

## 4. Success Metrics
- **KPIs**:
  - User retention (% returning to complete learning paths)
  - Knowledge improvement (test score improvements over time)
  - Time-to-mastery compared to traditional learning methods
  - User satisfaction scores
  - Completion rates of learning paths

- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - Quality and relevance of generated tests
  - Accuracy of gap identification
  - Relevance of recommended learning resources
  - User engagement with the testing/learning loop

## 5. Monetization Strategy
- **Initial Subscription Model (MVP)**:
  - Simple subscription-based access during initial launch
  - Focus on validating core value proposition with paying customers
  - Early adopter pricing to incentivize sign-ups and feedback

- **Evolved Freemium Model (Post-MVP)**:
  - Free tier: Full access to all subjects and content with ad support
  - Premium tier: Ad-free experience with quality-of-life improvements (offline access, enhanced analytics, etc.)
  - Student discount plans for semester/annual subscriptions

- **Ad Integration (Post-MVP)**:
  - Non-intrusive ad placements between tests and learning recommendations
  - Targeted educational ads (courses, books, tools)
  - Option to remove ads with subscription

- **Enterprise/Institution Plans**:
  - Bulk licensing for schools and universities
  - Custom dashboards for educators to monitor student progress
  - White-labeled versions for educational institutions

- **Additional Revenue Streams**:
