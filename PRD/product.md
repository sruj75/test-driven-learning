# Product Requirements Document: Test-Driven Learning

## 1. Product Overview
- **Product Name**: TestLearn (tentative)
- **Product Vision**: Revolutionize learning by flipping the traditional model - make tests the starting point rather than the endpoint of learning, creating a personalized, efficient, and goal-driven educational experience.
- **Target Audience**: 
  - University students across disciplines (Computer Science, Engineering, Business, Humanities, etc.)
  - High school students preparing for exams or building foundational knowledge
  - Graduate students (Master's, PhD) focusing on specialized topics
  - International students adapting to different educational systems
  - Students struggling with traditional learning approaches
- **Problem Statement**: Traditional education follows a "teach first, test later" model which is inefficient and not personalized. Students waste time learning content they already know or don't need, and often fail to identify their specific knowledge gaps until after completing entire courses.

## 2. User Stories & Requirements

### Core Features:
1. **Goal Setting Interface**
   - Users can set learning objectives or select from predefined topics
   - System breaks down goals into testable concepts

2. **Dynamic Test Generation**

5. **Test-Resource Learning Cycle**
   - Test → Resource → Test loop that drives the learning process
   - Focus on weak areas while maintaining coverage of all required concepts
   - Prevent memorization through question variation
   - Resource helpfulness feedback to improve recommendations

6. **Streamlined Authentication**
   - One-click Google sign-in for frictionless onboarding

   - Takes initial assessment test
   - Receives personalized learning resources (YouTube videos, explanations)
   - Studies resources and marks them as helpful/not helpful
   - Takes follow-up test targeting identified gaps
   - Cycle continues until mastery

2. **Return User Journey**:
   - Automatic authentication with Google account
   - Views dashboard with domains and progress
   - Continues from previous position in test-resource cycle
   - System recalls weak areas and focuses testing there
   - New resources based on latest performance

## 3. Design & Technical Considerations
- **UI/UX Direction**:
  - Clean, distraction-free testing environment
  - Intuitive progress visualization
  - Seamless transition between tests and resources
  - Mobile-responsive design for learning on the go

- **Technical Stack**: 
  - Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript/TSX and TailwindCSS
  - Backend: Next.js API routes
  - AI/LLM: Groq Cloud API (using OpenAI library compatibility)
  - External APIs: YouTube Data API, Google OAuth
  - Database: Supabase/PostgreSQL for user data and progress
  - Authentication: Supabase Auth with Google OAuth integration

- **Integration Requirements**:
  - YouTube API for resource recommendations
  - Groq Cloud API for test generation and concept explanations
  - Google OAuth for authentication
  - Stripe for subscription management
  - Analytics for user progress tracking

## 4. Success Metrics
- **KPIs**:
  - User retention (% returning to complete learning paths)
  - Knowledge improvement (test score improvements over time)
  - Time-to-mastery compared to traditional learning methods
  - User satisfaction scores
  - Completion rates of learning domains
  - Authentication conversion rate (% of users who complete Google sign-in)
  - Resource helpfulness rate (% of resources marked as helpful)

- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - Quality and relevance of generated tests
  - Accuracy of gap identification
  - Relevance of recommended learning resources
  - User engagement with the test-resource cycle
  - Authentication flow smoothness
  - Resource relevance and quality

## 5. Monetization Strategy

  - Premium tier: Ad-free experience with quality-of-life improvements (offline access, enhanced analytics, etc.)
  - Student discount plans for semester/annual subscriptions

- **Ad Integration (Post-MVP)**:
  - Non-intrusive ad placements between tests and resources
  - Targeted educational ads (courses, books, tools)
  - Option to remove ads with subscription

- **Enterprise/Institution Plans**:
  - Bulk licensing for schools and universities
  - Custom dashboards for educators to monitor student progress
  - White-labeled versions for educational institutions
